# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# Player.create([
#
#   {name:"brad"},
#   {name:"james"},
#   {name:"Darren"},
#   {name:"Maxine"},
#   {name:"Jacob"},
#   {name:"Myer"},
#   {name:"Rummy"},
#   {name:"George"},
#   {name:"Mitchell"}
#
#   ])

# Player.create(name:"brad")
